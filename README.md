# Criativiart

Criativiart is the final project carried out during my course as an internet information technician at Senac! This website was created based on research carried out during my course completion work (TCC), which focused on the need to create an environment focused on communication between digital artists. In this way, it would be possible to bring together a whole community of artists who need some kind of help with their creative processes through conversations with people who have been through/are going through the same problem.
